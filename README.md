# Law-of-Sines-Calculator
A C# console application that uses the law of sines (sin(A) / A = sin(B) / B = sin(C) / C) and user input to find the missing side of an oblique triangle. The user enters the first angle in degrees (an angle in which the opposite side is known). The program then calculates the sine of that angle (A) from degrees by converting the degrees into radians ((degrees * Ï€) / 180), then converting the radians into degrees using the Math.Sin( ) function. The user then enters the length of the side (A) opposite of that angle. Finally the user enters the angle opposite from the side with the unknown length, the computer reads back the sine for the second angle (B) and calculates the unknown side by multiplying the known side (opposite from angle A) by the sin(B), then dividing the product by the sin(A) to determine the side opposite of angle B.
